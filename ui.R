# This is the ui file.
# Use it to call elements created in your server file into the app, and define where they are placed.
# Also use this file to define inputs.
#
# Every UI file should contain:
# - A title for the app
# - A call to a CSS file to define the styling
# - An accessibility statement
# - Contact information
#
# Other elements like charts, navigation bars etc. are completely up to you to decide what goes in.
# However, every element should meet accessibility requirements and user needs.
#
# This fil e uses a slider input, but other inputs are available like date selections, multiple choice dropdowns etc.
# Use the shiny cheatsheet to explore more options: https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf
#
# Likewise, this template uses the navbar layout.
# We have used this as it meets accessibility requirements, but you are free to use another layout if it does too.
