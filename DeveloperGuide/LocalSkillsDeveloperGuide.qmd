## Introduction

The Local Skills dashboard is an R shiny dashboard displaying published local data from a variety of sources in an easy to navigate format. To support local skills planning, the dashboard covers topics such as employment, qualifications, and education outcomes across England.

This guide is for developers to update data or change the dashboard.

## I want to see the dashboard

The public dashboard is here:

<https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard/>

The pre production (where we test the dashboard before publishing) is here (you may need to get access):

<https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard-preprod/>

## I want to run the dashboard in R

1.  Connect to the git hub branch you want to run and pull to ensure you have the latest version:

    -   **Main** is the public facing branch - any pushes to this will be live on the web.

    -   **Development** is the pre-production (preprod) branch - any pushes to this will be live on the private preprod site.

    -   Or any other branch you would like to run.

The github page is here: <https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard>.

2.  Align your packages with the dashboards packages in your branch using renv: `renv::restore()`

3.  Run the dashboard. The dashboard will open in a new window: `runApp()`

The dashboard runs off the data held within /Data/AppData, so will just run without having to have data within your local Environment.

There may be times when you want to look at the dashboard in a browser (checking formatting across browsers or window sizes, or checking download functions). To do this click on the "Open in Browser" button at the top of the dashboard pop up window.

## I want to update a dataset

The Data Sources tab of the dashboard has a list of all the datasets and their next release date.

**Update schedule**

These are the common release points, however be aware that there may be revisions to any of the datasets throughout the year.

-   *Annual population survey* is released four times a year: 1) Jan 2) Apr 3) Jul/Aug/Sept 4) Oct. We update employment volumes and split by industry at every release. However:

    -   Highest qualification is only updated in the APS once a year in the Apr release.

    -   We are not currently updating Employment by Occupation until the SOC issue is sorted.

-   *Individualised learner record* is updated quarterly but we only update with the final data, usually release in November (the in year data is provisional and subject to lag).

-   *UK business count* is released and updated in the dashboard once a year in Sept/Oct.

-   *Business demography* is released and updated in the dashboard once a year in Nov.

-   *Destination measures* are released and updated in the dashboard once a year in Oct.

-   *Job adverts* were released for the first time in Feb 23. No release schedule has been announced.

-   *Skills Imperative 2035* was released in Mar 23. No release schedule has been announced.

| Month | Release        |             |              |

| Dec   |                |             |              |

**Update process**

1.  Make yourself a new github branch off (probably) the latest public version, so off Main. Pull and run `renv::restore()` to align packages with the dashboard.

*For non-NOMIS datasets:*

2a. Download the latest version of the dataset. If you need help finding the dataset source, have a look at the "Data Sources" tab in the dashboard - this gives info and links to data sources.

2b. Navigate to /Data folder (either in R Files or in Windows Explorer). All raw datasets are held in /Data. They are the numbered datasets.

-   1-x are geographical files (look ups and boundary files)

-   2-x are the raw local skills data files

-   3-x are excel files which populate tables within the dashboard and a 3-2_dataText helps populates the dynamic text in the Local Skills tab

2c. Once you have figured out where the dataset you want to update is currently kept, navigate to that folder

2d. Delete the currently held dataset(s) in that folder. The folder should now be empty.

2e. Paste the new dataset in that folder.

*For Nomis Datasets:*

You should just be able to skip to stage (3) (Run ExtractLoadData.R) - this pulls all the latest Nomis data. However, please take note that some of the datasets currently have hardcoded dates because ONS are not updating Occupation and Qualification data while they fix some problems. Once those problems are fixed the code can be changed to use the LATEST format used in the other Nomis datasets.

3.  Run the ExtractLoadData.R script. This goes through all the numbered folders in /Data and loads the datasets in each folder as a R object.

`source("~/RProjects/lsip_dashboard/ExtractLoadData.R", echo=TRUE)`

This takes about 20 mins. You should see your environment is now populated with data, including your new, updated dataset.

4.  We have datasets from a wide range of sources that come in all kinds of formats. We do a lot of data cleaning, manipulating and formatting to get into a format the dashboard can work with. We do this in the TransformData.R script. If your new datset is in the same (or even pretty close) format as the old dataset (as is hopefully the case), you just need run this script:

`source("~/RProjects/lsip_dashboard/TransformData.R", echo=TRUE)`

This takes about 20 mins. You should see your environment is populated with new, clean datasets and your Data/AppData folder has been updated with the updated versions of the files the dashboard uses.

5.  Dashboard admin:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  You need to update the dashboard's Data Sources tab with information about your new data. Open /Data/3-1_DataTable/DataTable.xlsx in Excel. Update the relevant row with new dates, links and information.

b.  Update the dashboard's Version Log. This is done in ui.R under the "2.1.3 Version control" header. Move the current Latest Version text down into the Previous Version area, and repopulate the Current Version with new details.

c.  You may need to update the Latest Period and/or the data caveats in the /Data/3-2_dataText/dataText.xlsx file as well. These are used to populate dynamic text on the dashboard's Local Skills tab.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  Run the dashboard: `runApp()`

7.  QA. Create a new QA log in "Analytical Projects\\Analysis\\S005 LSIP dashboard\\Documentation\\QA". Follow the structure of one already in there. Some checks you may do:

-   Check that your dataset has been updated correctly (by comparing with the version you branched off of and cross checking with the raw data).
-   Check the Data Sources table has been updated correctly
-   Check the text in the Local Skills tab makes sense for your updated metric.
-   Get sign off Hannah Cox and/or Harris (see [here](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/UnitforFutureSkills/Shared%20Documents/Analytical%20Projects/Analysis/S005%20LSIP%20dashboard/Documentation/Local%20skills%20dashboard%20update%20principles.docx?d=wbd95fecb97144a348a73a34520212d75&csf=1&web=1&e=InX9xM) and [here](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/UnitforFutureSkills/Shared%20Documents/Analytical%20Projects/Analysis/S005%20LSIP%20dashboard/Documentation/QA/QA%20plan_Local%20Skills%20dashboard_UFS.docx?d=wa17c64605c7f4a3fb2b8bf35f4bec670&csf=1&web=1&e=Z66Jas) for process)

8.  If everything looks ok, commit, push and merge to Development. Wait for that to deploy (can take 15mins or more - you can track this in [Actions · dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard (github.com)](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard/actions)). Again check everything looks ok in the preprod environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard-preprod/> 13 If you have done sufficient QA and you are satisfied, merge to Main and wait for that to deploy. Check again everything looks ok in the live environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard/>

9.  Consider communicating the change to the wider Team or other stakeholders.

## I want to add a metric to the dashboard

Make yourself a new github branch off (probably) the latest public version, so off Main. Pull and run `renv::restore()` to align packages with the dashboard.

### It's a metric that already exists in the data.

We currently have a fair few metrics that exist in the data but aren't being shown in the dashboard:

"all", "economicallyactive", "employees", "starts_rate_per_100000_population", "starts", "active", "births", "deaths", "qualNone", "qualL1", "qualL2", "qualApp", "qualL3", "qualL4", "qualOther","employmentProjection"

To add one of these into the dashboard:

1.  Remove the metric from the unused list in TransformData.R under the "4.1 Unused metrics" header.

2.  Add your metric into metricChoices in global.R and assign it a more user friendly name for use in the dashboard.

3.  Add a row into /Data/3-2_dataText/dataText.xlsx for your metric assigning it the relevant text.

4.  Run TransformData.R

5.  Run `runApp()` and check the metric is available in the Local Skills tab.

6.  QA. Create a new QA log in "Analytical Projects\\Analysis\\S005 LSIP dashboard\\Documentation\\QA". Follow the structure of one already in there. Some checks you may do:

    -   Check that your dataset has been added correctly (by comparing with the version you branched off of and cross checking with the raw data).
    -   Check the Data Sources table has been updated correctly
    -   Check the text in the Local Skills tab makes sense for your updated metric.
    -   Check the charts are in the format you want especially looking at whether it needs to be a percentage or volume

7.  If everything looks ok, commit, push and merge to Development. Wait for that to deploy (can take 15mins or more - you can track this in [Actions · dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard (github.com)](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard/actions)). Again check everything looks ok in the preprod environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard-preprod/>

8.  If you have done sufficient QA and you are satisfied, merge to Main and wait for that to deploy. Check again everything looks ok in the live environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard/>

9.  Consider communicating the change to the wider Team or other stakeholders.

**Optional extras/troubleshooting**

-   You might need to make some adjustments to how it is presented in the charts ie percentage vs vol. If the problem is in the time chart or map, check server.R where there are a few if statements to assign a metric to either % or vol. If the problem is in the breakdown chart check the server and TransformData where some metrics are split into proportions and some are not.

-   If you want it to appear in the Data Explorer tab, remove it from the exclusion list in TransformData.r/4.4 C_dataHub and give it a good name in there as well.

-   You may want to add to the Overview page. If so, add to ui.R wherever you want and create KPIs and charts in server.R using the following function: createOverviewKPI, createOverviewChart, renderOverviewChart.

### It's a brand new metric

1.  Create a new folder for your new dataset in /Data. Labels the folder 2-x_datasetName.

2.  Paste your data into this folder.

3.  Dashboard admin:

    a.  You need to update the dashboard's Data Sources tab with information about your new data. Open /Data/3-1_DataTable/DataTable.xlsx in Excel. Add a new row with new dates, links and information. You also need to add some information about the dataset on this page. You can do this in ui.R/2.5.2 Data details text.

    b.  Update the dashboard's Version Log. This is done in ui.R under the "2.1.3 Version control" header. Move the current Latest Version text down into the Previous Version area, and repopulate the Current Version with new details.

    c.  Populate a new row in /Data/3-2_dataText/dataText.xlsx file. These are used to populate dynamic text on the dashboard's Local Skills tab.

    d.  Add some overview information about the dataset on the User Guide page of the dashboard. an do this in ui.R/2.1.2 Contents

4.  Add some data extraction code to ExtractLoadData.R (copy one of the examples in there) directing to your new folder and giving your data a name like I_datasetName.

5.  Run ExtractLoadData.R. You should now have your raw data in your local environment.

6.  You then need to format your data so that it matches the form the dashboard is prepared for. This code is written in TransformData.R.

    a\. Firstly clean the raw data so it is a usable format with headings and data rows. There are some functions within TransformData.R that might help (formatNomis cleans Nomis data, formatLong puts data into long format)

    b\. Ensure you have data for all the geographic areas used in the dashboard: LADUs, LSIPs, LEPs, MCAs, and national.

    If your data only comes in LADU form, you can groups these up to get the bigger geographcal areas. The function addGeos will help with this, but might not always be exacly what you want, so check. If you are grouping up, there will likely be some rounding errors so make sure to add that caveat to the Data Sources tab.

    c\. You then need to manipulate your now clean data into the following form:

| Column name | Description                                                                                                            | Format    | Example           |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| geogConcat  | Area name and geography                                                                                                | character | Black Country LEP |
| metric      | Variable of interest                                                                                                   | character | inemployment      |
| breakdown   | *If* the dataset has a breakdown they are listed here. Every metric **must** have a "Total" as well as any breakdowns. | character | Age               |
| subgroup    | Any subgroups of the breakdown. If breakdown is "Total" this is also "Total"                                           | character | 19-24             |
| chartPeriod | The period which the data relates to in plain English.                                                                 | character | AY20/21           |
| timePeriod  | The start date of the period.                                                                                          | character | 01/08/2020        |
| latest      | 1 if this is the most recent period in the data. -1 is one year before that. 0 for any other.                          | numeric   | -1                |
| valueText   | The value of the metric in this subgroup. Includes any supression from the source.                                     | character | 5000              |
| value       | The value of the metric in this subgroup in numeric terms. NA if suppressed.                                           | numeric   | 5000              |

7.  Give the now clean and formatted dataset a name like C_dataName and add into TransformData.R/3. Combine datasets.

8.  Run TransformData.R. You should see some new files in your local environment and the data in Data/AppData will have updated to include your new metric.

9.  Add your metric into metricChoices in global.R and assign it a more user friendly name for use in the dashboard.

10. Give your metric a good name for the Data Explorer tab in TransformData.r/4.4 C_dataHub.

11. Run the app `runApp()`.

12. QA. Create a new QA log in "Analytical Projects\\Analysis\\S005 LSIP dashboard\\Documentation\\QA". Follow the structure of one already in there. Some checks you may do:

    -   Check that your dataset has been added correctly (by comparing with the version you branched off of and cross checking with the raw data).
    -   Check the Data Sources table has been updated correctly
    -   Check the text in the Local Skills tab makes sense for your updated metric.
    -   Check the charts are in the format you want especially looking at whether it needs to be a percentage or volume

13. Take a renv snapshot to help future users allign to any packages you have changed/added:`renv::snapshot()`

14. If everything looks ok, commit, push and merge to Development. Wait for that to deploy (can take 15mins or more - you can track this in [Actions · dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard (github.com)](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/lsip_dashboard/actions)). Again check everything looks ok in the preprod environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard-preprod/>

15. If you have done sufficient QA and you are satisfied, merge to Main and wait for that to deploy. Check again everything looks ok in the live environment: <https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/local-skills-dashboard/>

16. Consider communicating the change to the wider Team or other stakeholders.

**Optional extras/troubleshooting**

-   You might need to make some adjustments to how it is presented in the charts ie percentage vs vol. If the problem is in the time chart or map, check server.R where there are a few if statements to assign a metric to either % or vol. If the problem is in the breakdown chart check the server and TransformData where some metrics are split into proportions and some are not.

-   You may want to add to the Overview page. If so, add to ui.R wherever you want and create KPIs and charts in server.R using the following function: createOverviewKPI, createOverviewChart, renderOverviewChart

## I want to monitor dashboard usage

We use Google Analytics to see a range of metrics on dashboard users. Log in here (you may need access): <https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/>.

As well as the more generic metrics (users, new users, event clicks, time spent), we have been collecting specific events from the dashboard. You can see the things we monitor in /google-analytics.html. You can add tracking for whatever dashboard event you want and then monitor that event within Google Analytics.

In Google Analytics we have started creating custom reports to collect some interesting data. You can see these (and create these) by clicking the "Explore" tab in the left of the Google Analytics page.
