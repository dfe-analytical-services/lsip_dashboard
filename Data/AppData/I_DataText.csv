A sustained destination is a count of young people recorded as having sustained participation (education and employment) for a 6 month period in the destination year.
This means attending for all of the first two terms of the academic year (e.g. October 2021 to March 2022) at one or more education providers; spending 5 of the 6 months in employment or a combination of the two.
A sustained apprenticeship is recorded when 6 months continuous participation is recorded at any point in the destination year (between August 2021 and July 2022).
Not recorded includes pupils who were captured in the destination source data but who failed to meet the sustained participation criteria.
Unknown (activity not captured): The student was not found to have any participation in education, apprenticeship or employment nor recorded as receiving out-of-work benefits at any point in the year. This also includes not being recorded by their Local Authority as NEET (not engaged in education, employment or training).","<ol>

<li>The definition of when a student is at the end of 16 to 18 study has changed last year and comparisons to previous cohorts should be treated with caution. Students are included in this statistical release when they reach the end of 16 to 18 study. The ‘trigger’ rules for deciding when this happens changed in 2020/21. Further details can be found in the <a href = https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/16-18-destination-measures'>publication</a>.</li>
<li>There was no checking exercise for this cohort of students. The checking exercise ordinarily allows schools and colleges to confirm whether the students we report are at end of 16 to 18 study. This means that this data may not accurately represent whether students were at the end of 16 to 18 study in 2020/21.</li>
